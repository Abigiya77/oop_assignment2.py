Assignment 1: Object-Oriented Programming in Python 🐍
Overview

This repository contains solutions for Assignment 1, which focuses on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Python. The assignment has two activities:

Design Your Own Class – A Smartphone class is created with attributes and methods. A subclass GamingPhone demonstrates inheritance.

Polymorphism Challenge – A Vehicle base class and its subclasses (Car, Plane, Boat) demonstrate polymorphism by overriding the move() method.

Features
Activity 1 – Smartphone Class

Constructor: Initializes unique attributes for each smartphone object.

Methods:

make_call(number) – Simulates making a call.

take_photo() – Simulates taking a photo.

battery_status() – Displays remaining battery.

Inheritance: GamingPhone inherits from Smartphone and adds a play_game(game) method.

Activity 2 – Polymorphism Challenge

Base Class: Vehicle with a generic move() method.

Subclasses:

Car → move() prints "Driving on the road 🚗"

Plane → move() prints "Flying in the sky ✈️"

Boat → move() prints "Sailing on water 🚤"

Demonstrates polymorphism by calling move() on different vehicle objects.

How to Run

Clone the repository:

git clone <your-repo-link>


Open assignment1.py in VS Code or any Python IDE.

Run the script:

python assignment1.py


Observe the outputs for both activities in the terminal.
